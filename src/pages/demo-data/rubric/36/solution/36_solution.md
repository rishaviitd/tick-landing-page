# Solution for 36

**Question:** 36. Rahul is a lucky charm for his cricket team. He has a jar of cards with numbers from 10 to 74. Before each match, he draws a card from the jar. If the card bears an even number, the team wins. If the number is even and divisible by 5, they win by a big margin. If the number is an odd number less than 30, they win by a small margin. And if the number is a prime number between 50 and 74, they lose.
Answer the following questions if Rahul draws a card today :
(i) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an even number?
(ii) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an odd number less than 30?
(iii) (a) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with a prime number between 50 and 74?
[%OR%]
(b) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an even number divisible by 5?

**Reasoning:**
- This question has sub-parts. Part (i) is 1 mark, requiring [1 to 2] steps. Part (ii) is 1 mark, requiring [1 to 2] steps. Part (iii) has an internal choice; both (a) and (b) are 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps each.
- **I will now process each part sequentially, considering the context of prior parts and strictly adhering to these step counts for every method proposed.**

### **Part (i)**
---
**Method 1: Direct Calculation of Probability for Even Numbers**
- Step i_1:
  - Step ID: i_1
  - Teacher Expectation: Determine the total number of possible outcomes (cards in the jar).
  - Pass if: Correctly states the total number of cards as 65 (from 10 to 74 inclusive).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly calculates the total number of cards or omits this step.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step i_2:
  - Step ID: i_2
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the count of favorable outcomes (even numbers in the range) and compute the probability.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies 33 even numbers (10, 12, ..., 74) and states the probability as 33/65.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly counts even numbers or states the probability incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A

### **Part (ii)**
---
**Method 1: Direct Calculation of Probability for Odd Numbers Less Than 30**
- Step ii_1:
  - Step ID: ii_1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the total number of possible outcomes from the jar.
  - Pass if: Correctly states or refers to the total number of cards as 65.
  - Fail if: States an incorrect total number of cards or omits this step.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step ii_2:
  - Step ID: ii_2
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the count of favorable outcomes (odd numbers less than 30 within the given range) and compute the probability.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies the odd numbers less than 30 as {11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29} (10 numbers) and states the probability as 10/65 (or simplified 2/13).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly lists or counts the odd numbers less than 30, or states the probability incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A

### **Part (iii)**
---
**Method 1: Calculation for Prime Numbers Between 50 and 74 (Choice a)**
- Step iii-a_1:
  - Step ID: iii-a_1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the total number of possible outcomes from the jar.
  - Pass if: Correctly states or refers to the total number of cards as 65.
  - Fail if: States an incorrect total number of cards or omits this step.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step iii-a_2:
  - Step ID: iii-a_2
  - Teacher Expectation: List all prime numbers within the specified range (50 to 74).
  - Pass if: Correctly lists the prime numbers as {53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73}.
  - Fail if: Misses any prime number or includes any non-prime number in the list.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step iii-a_3:
  - Step ID: iii-a_3
  - Teacher Expectation: Count the favorable outcomes (prime numbers) and compute the probability.
  - Pass if: Correctly counts 6 prime numbers and states the probability as 6/65.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly counts the prime numbers or states the probability incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A

--- OR ---

**Method 1: Calculation for Even Numbers Divisible by 5 (Choice b)**
- Step iii-b_1:
  - Step ID: iii-b_1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the total number of possible outcomes from the jar.
  - Pass if: Correctly states or refers to the total number of cards as 65.
  - Fail if: States an incorrect total number of cards or omits this step.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step iii-b_2:
  - Step ID: iii-b_2
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the favorable outcomes (even numbers divisible by 5) within the given range.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies that numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 are multiples of 10, and lists them as {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly identifies or lists the numbers.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step iii-b_3:
  - Step ID: iii-b_3
  - Teacher Expectation: Count the favorable outcomes and compute the probability.
  - Pass if: Correctly counts 7 such numbers and states the probability as 7/65.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly counts the numbers or states the probability incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A

If the card bears an even number, the team wins. If the number is even and divisible by 5, they win by a big margin. If the number is an odd number less than 30, they win by a small margin. And if the number is a prime number between 50 and 74, they lose.\nAnswer the following questions if Rahul draws a card today :\n(i) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an even number?\n(ii) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an odd number less than 30?\n(iii) (a) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with a prime number between 50 and 74?\n[%OR%]\n(b) What is the probability that Rahul draws a card with an even number divisible by 5?",

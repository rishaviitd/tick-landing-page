# Solution for 38

**Question:** 38. A school is organizing a grand cultural event to show the talent of its students. To accommodate the guests, the school plans to rent chairs and tables from a local supplier. It finds that rent for each chair is ₹50 and for each table is ₹ 200. The school spends ₹ 30,000 for renting the chairs and tables. Also, the total number of items (chairs and tables) rented are 300.
If the school rents 'x' chairs and ‘y' tables, answer the following questions :
(i) Write down the pair of linear equations representing the given information.
(ii) (a) Find the number of chairs and number of tables rented by the school.
[%OR%]
(b) If the school wants to spend a maximum of ₹ 27,000 on 300 items (tables and chairs), then find the number of chairs and tables it can rent.
(iii) What is maximum number of tables that can be rented in ₹ 30,000 if no chairs are rented ?

  - Mark Type: A

--- OR ---

**Method 1: Inequality Formulation and Solution for alternative scenario**

**Part (ii)(b)**
- Step ii-b_1:
  - Step ID: ii-b_1
  - Teacher Expectation: Set up the equation for the total number of items and the inequality for the total cost based on the new constraint.
  - Pass if: The equation `x + y = 300` and the inequality `50x + 200y ≤ 27000` are correctly formulated.
  - Fail if: Either the equation or the inequality is incorrect or missing.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step ii-b_2:
  - Step ID: ii-b_2
  - Teacher Expectation: Use substitution to express one variable in terms of the other in the cost inequality.
  - Pass if: The student correctly substitutes `x = 300 - y` (or `y = 300 - x`) into the inequality `50x + 200y ≤ 27000`.
  - Fail if: The substitution is performed incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step ii-b_3:
  - Step ID: ii-b_3
  - Teacher Expectation: Solve the resulting inequality to find the range for one variable.

  - Fail if: The inequality is solved incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step ii-b_4:
  - Step ID: ii-b_4
  - Teacher Expectation: Determine a specific valid pair of values for chairs and tables that satisfies both the total item constraint and the cost inequality.
  - Pass if: A pair of values (e.g., 220 chairs and 80 tables) is provided which satisfies `x + y = 300` and `50x + 200y ≤ 27000`.
  - Fail if: The provided pair of values does not satisfy both conditions, or no pair is provided.
  - Mark Type: A

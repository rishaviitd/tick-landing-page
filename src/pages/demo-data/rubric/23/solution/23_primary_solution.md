# Solution for 23_primary

**Question:** 23. (a) In the given figure, the shape of the top of a table is that of a sector of a circle with centre O and $\angle AOB = 90^\circ$. If AO = OB = 42 cm, then find the perimeter of the top of the table.

**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution.
- **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- The question assesses the ability to apply the formula for the perimeter of a sector, which involves calculating the arc length and adding the lengths of the two radii.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to identify the components of the perimeter of the sector (arc length and two radii), calculate the arc length using the given angle and radius, and then sum these components to find the total perimeter.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies that the perimeter of the sector consists of the arc length AB and the two radii OA and OB.
  - Pass if: Correctly states or implies that Perimeter = Arc Length (AB) + OA + OB.
  - Fail if: Omits any component or includes incorrect components.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the length of the arc AB using the formula for arc length of a sector: Arc Length = $(\theta/360^\circ) \times 2\pi r$.
  - Pass if: Correctly substitutes the values ($\theta = 90^\circ$, $r = 42$ cm) and performs the calculation, yielding the arc length.
  - Fail if: Uses an incorrect formula, substitutes incorrect values, or makes a calculation error.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the total perimeter by adding the arc length (from Step 2) and the lengths of the two radii (OA + OB = 42 cm + 42 cm).
  - Pass if: Correctly adds the calculated arc length and the sum of the two radii to arrive at the final perimeter.
  - Fail if: Makes an addition error or uses an incorrect value from previous steps.
  - Mark Type: A

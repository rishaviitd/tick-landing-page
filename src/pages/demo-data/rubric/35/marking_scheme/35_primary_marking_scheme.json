  "Question_specific_notes": "This question assesses the application of trigonometry to solve a problem involving speed. Students must accurately draw a diagram, use the tangent function correctly for both angles of elevation, calculate the difference in horizontal distances, and then determine the speed using the given time and the provided value for $\\sqrt{3}$. Common errors may include incorrect diagram setup, misapplication of trigonometric ratios, or calculation mistakes, particularly with the square root term. Ensure to apply follow-through (ecf) for calculation errors in intermediate steps if subsequent steps use the incorrect value correctly."

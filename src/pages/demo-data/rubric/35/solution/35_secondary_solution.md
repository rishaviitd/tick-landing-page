# Solution for 35_secondary

**Question:** (b) A girl 1.5 m tall is standing at some distance from a 30 m high tower. The angle of elevation from her eye to the top of the tower increases from 30° to 60° as she walks towards the tower. Find the distance she walked towards the tower.

**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 5 marks, requiring [5 to 10] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first determine the effective height of the tower from the girl's eye level. Then, set up two right-angled triangles using the given angles of elevation and the effective height. Solve these triangles using trigonometric ratios (tangent) to find the initial and final distances of the girl from the tower. Finally, calculate the difference between these two distances to find the distance walked.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the vertical height of the tower from the girl's eye level.
  - Pass if: Correctly computes `30 m - 1.5 m = 28.5 m`.
  - Fail if: Uses the full tower height (30 m) or makes an arithmetic error in subtraction.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Draws and labels a diagram illustrating the scenario with two right-angled triangles.
  - Pass if: Diagram shows the tower, ground, girl's position at two points, the effective height (28.5 m), the two angles of elevation (30° and 60°), and labels for initial distance (say, `x`) and final distance (say, `y`).
  - Fail if: Diagram is missing, incomplete, or incorrectly labeled.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Sets up the trigonometric equation for the initial position using the angle of elevation of 30°.
  - Pass if: Correctly forms the equation `tan(30°) = 28.5 / x` (or equivalent, where `x` is the initial distance from the tower).
  - Fail if: Uses an incorrect trigonometric ratio or incorrectly relates height and distance.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Sets up the trigonometric equation for the final position using the angle of elevation of 60°.
  - Pass if: Correctly forms the equation `tan(60°) = 28.5 / y` (or equivalent, where `y` is the final distance from the tower).
  - Fail if: Uses an incorrect trigonometric ratio or incorrectly relates height and distance.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Solves the two trigonometric equations to find the initial distance (`x`) and the final distance (`y`).
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates `x = 28.5 / tan(30°) = 28.5√3` and `y = 28.5 / tan(60°) = 28.5/√3`.
  - Fail if: Makes errors in substituting trigonometric values or in algebraic manipulation to find `x` and `y`.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the difference between the initial and final distances to find the distance the girl walked.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates `(x - y) = 28.5√3 - 28.5/√3 = 28.5(√3 - 1/√3) = 28.5(2/√3) = 57/√3 = 19√3` meters.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic or simplification error in calculating the final distance walked.
  - Mark Type: A

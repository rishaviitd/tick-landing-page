  "primary_question": "35. (a) The angle of elevation of an airborne helicopter from a point A on the ground is 45\u00b0. After a flight of 15 seconds, the angle of elevation of the helicopter changes to 30\u00b0. If the helicopter is flying at a constant height of 2000 m, find the speed of the helicopter. (Take $\\sqrt{3} = 1.732$)",
  "secondary_question": "(b) A girl 1.5 m tall is standing at some distance from a 30 m high tower. The angle of elevation from her eye to the top of the tower increases from 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 as she walks towards the tower. Find the distance she walked towards the tower.",

# Solution for 28

**Question:** 28. A sum of ₹ 2,000 is invested at 7% per annum simple interest. Calculate the interests at the end of 1st, 2nd and 3rd year. Do these interests form an AP ? If so, find the interest at the end of the 27th year.

**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 3 marks, requiring [3 to 6] steps for the entire solution. I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first calculate the simple interest for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years individually. Then, verify if these interests form an arithmetic progression by checking for a constant common difference. Finally, if it forms an AP, use the nth term formula to calculate the interest for the 27th year.
- Method 2: The plan is to identify the principal and rate, calculate the simple interest for one year, and state that this value serves as both the first term and the common difference of the AP. Subsequently, apply the nth term formula of an AP to find the interest for the 27th year.

**Method 1: Step-by-step calculation and AP verification**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the principal amount (P = ₹2000) and the annual rate of interest (R = 7%).
  - Pass if: Both P and R are correctly identified and stated.
  - Fail if: Either P or R is incorrectly stated or omitted.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the simple interest earned at the end of the 1st year using the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100, with T=1 year.
  - Pass if: The calculated simple interest for 1 year is correct.
  - Fail if: The calculation is incorrect or the formula is misapplied.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the simple interest earned at the end of the 2nd year using the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100, with T=2 years.
  - Pass if: The calculated simple interest for 2 years is correct.
  - Fail if: The calculation is incorrect or the formula is misapplied.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the simple interest earned at the end of the 3rd year using the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100, with T=3 years.
  - Pass if: The calculated simple interest for 3 years is correct.
  - Fail if: The calculation is incorrect or the formula is misapplied.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Determines if the interests calculated for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years form an Arithmetic Progression (AP) by verifying that the difference between consecutive interests is constant.
  - Pass if: The common difference (SI_2yr - SI_1yr) is calculated, the common difference (SI_3yr - SI_2yr) is calculated, and it is correctly concluded that these differences are equal, thus forming an AP.
  - Fail if: Either difference is calculated incorrectly, or the conclusion about forming an AP is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the interest at the end of the 27th year using the nth term formula for an AP (a_n = a + (n-1)d), where 'a' is the interest for the 1st year and 'd' is the common difference.
  - Pass if: The correct values for 'a', 'd', and 'n' (n=27) are substituted into the formula, and the final calculation for the 27th year's interest is accurate.
  - Fail if: The formula is misapplied, incorrect values are used, or the final calculation is wrong.
  - Mark Type: A

**Method 2: Conceptual understanding of constant simple interest**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the principal amount (P = ₹2000) and the annual rate of interest (R = 7%).
  - Pass if: Both P and R are correctly identified and stated.
  - Fail if: Either P or R is incorrectly stated or omitted.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the simple interest for one year (SI_1yr) and states that this value represents both the first term (a) and the common difference (d) of the AP formed by annual simple interest.
  - Pass if: SI_1yr is correctly calculated, and it is explicitly stated that a = SI_1yr and d = SI_1yr.
  - Fail if: SI_1yr is incorrect, or it is not stated that this value is both 'a' and 'd'.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: States that simple interest earned each year is constant, thus forming an Arithmetic Progression.
  - Pass if: The formation of an AP is correctly stated based on the constant nature of simple interest.
  - Fail if: The statement about AP formation is incorrect or missing.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the nth term formula for an AP, a_n = a + (n-1)d, to find the interest at the end of the 27th year (n=27).
  - Pass if: The formula is correctly written and the values for 'a', 'd', and 'n' are correctly substituted.
  - Fail if: The formula is miswritten or incorrect values are substituted.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the final interest amount for the 27th year.
  - Pass if: The final calculation using the substituted values is accurate.
  - Fail if: The final calculation is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution.
- I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first identify the two triangles in the figure that are similar, using the given angle equality and a common angle. Then, state the similarity criterion. Finally, write down the proportionality of the corresponding sides of these similar triangles and rearrange the equation to arrive at the required result.

**Method 1: Using AA Similarity**

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the two triangles to be considered, $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle BAC$. States the given angle equality $\angle ADC = \angle BAC$ and identifies $\angle C$ as a common angle to both triangles.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle BAC$, and correctly states both $\angle ADC = \angle BAC$ (given) and $\angle C = \angle C$ (common).
  - Fail if: Fails to identify the correct triangles or misses either of the angle conditions.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Concludes that $\triangle ADC$ is similar to $\triangle BAC$ using the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, based on the angle equalities stated in the previous step.
  - Pass if: Correctly states the similarity $\triangle ADC \sim \triangle BAC$ with the AA criterion.
  - Fail if: Incorrect similarity statement or incorrect similarity criterion is used.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Writes the correct ratio of corresponding sides from the similarity $\triangle ADC \sim \triangle BAC$, specifically $\frac{DC}{AC} = \frac{AC}{BC}$. Then, rearranges this equation algebraically to show $CA^2 = CD \cdot CB$.
  - Pass if: Correctly writes the ratio of corresponding sides and correctly derives the final result $CA^2 = CD \cdot CB$.
  - Fail if: The ratio of corresponding sides is incorrect or the algebraic manipulation to reach the final result is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A

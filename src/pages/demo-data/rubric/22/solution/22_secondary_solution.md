**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution.
- **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first rearrange the given product of line segments to establish the proportionality of sides. Then, identify the relevant triangles and the equality of vertically opposite angles. Subsequently, apply the SAS similarity criterion to prove the similarity of the triangles. Finally, state the equality of corresponding angles to complete the proof.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Rearrange the given condition $OA \cdot OB = OC \cdot OD$ to establish the proportionality of sides required for similarity.
  - Pass if: Correctly writes the ratio $\frac{OA}{OC} = \frac{OD}{OB}$ or $\frac{OA}{OD} = \frac{OC}{OB}$.
  - Fail if: Fails to rearrange the equation correctly or omits this step.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Identify the two triangles involved in the figure ($\triangle OAD$ and $\triangle OCB$) and state the reason for the equality of the included angles.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies $\triangle OAD$ and $\triangle OCB$, and states $\angle AOD = \angle COB$ as vertically opposite angles.
  - Fail if: Identifies incorrect triangles or provides an incorrect reason for angle equality.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Apply the SAS similarity criterion using the proportional sides and the equal included angle.
  - Pass if: Correctly states that $\triangle OAD \sim \triangle OCB$ (or $\triangle OCB \sim \triangle OAD$) by SAS similarity.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly applies the SAS criterion or makes an error in the similarity statement.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Conclude by stating the equality of the required angles as corresponding angles of the similar triangles.
  - Pass if: Correctly states $\angle OAD = \angle OCB$ (i.e., $\angle A = \angle C$) and $\angle ODA = \angle OBC$ (i.e., $\angle D = \angle B$) with the reason "corresponding angles of similar triangles".
  - Fail if: Fails to state the correct angle equalities or omits the correct reason.
  - Mark Type: A

  "solution": "Since MN is a diameter, the angle subtended by the diameter at L is 90° (∠MLN = 90°). In triangle MLN, ∠LNM = 180° - 90° - 30° = 60°. By the tangent-chord theorem, the angle between tangent RS and chord LM (∠RLM) is equal to the angle in the alternate segment (∠LNM). Therefore, ∠RLM = 60°."

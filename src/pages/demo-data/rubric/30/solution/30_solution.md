# Solution for 30

**Question:** 30. The length of the hour hand of a clock is 10 cm. Find the area of the minor sector swept by the hour hand of the clock between 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. Also, find the area of the major sector.

**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 3 marks, requiring [3 to 6] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- The question assesses the application of the sector area formula in a real-world context (clock). It requires calculating the angle subtended by the hour hand over a specific time interval and then finding both the minor and major sector areas.

**Method solution:**
- **Method 1:** The plan is to first determine the time duration and the angle subtended by the hour hand for the minor sector. Then, calculate the area of the minor sector. Subsequently, determine the angle for the major sector and calculate its area.
- **Method 2:** The plan is to first determine the time duration and the angle subtended by the hour hand for the minor sector. Then, calculate the area of the minor sector. Subsequently, calculate the total area of the circle and derive the area of the major sector by subtracting the minor sector area from the total area.

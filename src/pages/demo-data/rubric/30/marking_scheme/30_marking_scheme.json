  "Question_specific_notes": "Students should be assessed on their ability to correctly identify the radius, calculate the time duration and corresponding angle for the hour hand, and apply the sector area formula. Ensure follow-through (ft/ecf) is applied for calculation errors in intermediate steps. Common errors may include incorrect angle calculation (e.g., using minutes instead of hours for the hour hand) or confusing minor and major sectors."

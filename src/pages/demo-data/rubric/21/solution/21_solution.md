**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to identify the given zeroes, calculate their sum and product, and then use these values to construct the quadratic polynomial in the standard form $k(x^2 - (\text{sum})x + (\text{product}))$.
- Method 2: The plan is to identify the given zeroes and use the factored form of a quadratic polynomial, $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$, substitute the zeroes, and then expand and simplify the expression to obtain the final polynomial.

**Method 1: Using Sum and Product of Zeroes**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the given zeroes as $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
  - Pass if: Correctly assigns the values $2$ and $-7/5$ to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (or vice versa).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly identifies the zeroes or their values.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the sum of the zeroes ($\alpha + \beta$).
  - Pass if: Correctly computes the sum as $2 + (-7/5) = 3/5$.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic error in calculating the sum.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the product of the zeroes ($\alpha \beta$).
  - Pass if: Correctly computes the product as $2 \times (-7/5) = -14/5$.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic error in calculating the product.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Forms the quadratic polynomial by substituting the calculated sum and product into the standard form $k(x^2 - (\text{sum})x + (\text{product}))$.
  - Pass if: Correctly substitutes the sum and product to form the polynomial $k(x^2 - (3/5)x - 14/5)$ or an equivalent form (e.g., $x^2 - (3/5)x - 14/5$ assuming $k=1$).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly substitutes the sum/product or uses the wrong polynomial formula.
  - Mark Type: A

**Method 2: Using Factored Form $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the given zeroes as $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
  - Pass if: Correctly assigns the values $2$ and $-7/5$ to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (or vice versa).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly identifies the zeroes or their values.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Sets up the quadratic polynomial in the factored form $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$.
  - Pass if: Writes the expression as $(x-2)(x - (-7/5))$.
  - Fail if: Uses an incorrect factored form or incorrect values for the zeroes.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Expands and simplifies the factored expression to obtain the final polynomial.
  - Pass if: Correctly expands and simplifies to $x^2 - (3/5)x - 14/5$ or an equivalent form.
  - Fail if: Makes errors in expansion or simplification.
  - Mark Type: A

  "solution": "Assertion (A) is true because for the given equations, $p=1$ leads to $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{59}{118}$, satisfying the condition for infinitely many solutions. Reason (R) is true because for the given equations, $p \\neq 1$ leads to $\\frac{p}{2} \\neq \\frac{3}{6}$, satisfying the condition for a unique solution. However, Reason (R) discusses the condition for a unique solution, which does not directly explain why $p=1$ results in infinitely many solutions as stated in Assertion (A)."

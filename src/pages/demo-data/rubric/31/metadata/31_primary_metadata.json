  "assessment_intent": "This question assesses the student's ability to apply geometric theorems related to circles and parallelograms to prove that a parallelogram circumscribing a circle must be a rhombus. It requires understanding the property that tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length, and relating this to the properties of a parallelogram.",

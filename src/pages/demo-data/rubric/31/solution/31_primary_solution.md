**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 3 marks, requiring [3 to 6] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.
- Assessment Intent: To assess the student's ability to apply geometric theorems concerning tangents to a circle and properties of parallelograms to prove that a parallelogram circumscribing a circle is a rhombus.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to draw a diagram, state the relevant theorem about tangents from an external point, apply this theorem to the sides of the parallelogram, use the properties of a parallelogram (opposite sides are equal), and then use algebraic manipulation to demonstrate that adjacent sides are equal, thus proving it is a rhombus.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Draw a diagram of a parallelogram ABCD circumscribing a circle, marking the points of tangency on each side. State the theorem: "Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length."
  - Pass if: A correct diagram of a parallelogram circumscribing a circle is drawn, with points of tangency clearly marked, and the theorem regarding equal tangents from an external point is accurately stated.
  - Fail if: The diagram is incorrect, points of tangency are not marked, or the tangent theorem is stated incorrectly or omitted.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Apply the tangent theorem to express the sides of the parallelogram in terms of equal tangent segments originating from each vertex.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies and states the equality of tangent segments from each vertex (e.g., AP = AS, BP = BQ, CQ = CR, DR = DS).
  - Fail if: Any pair of equal tangent segments is incorrectly identified or omitted.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal (AB = CD and BC = DA). Substitute the expressions for the sides, formed by the tangent segments from Step 2, into these equalities.
  - Pass if: Correctly states the sides in terms of tangent segments (e.g., AB = AP + PB) and sets up the equations from opposite sides being equal (e.g., AP + PB = CR + DR and BQ + QC = DS + SA).
  - Fail if: Incorrectly states the sides or the parallelogram property, or fails to substitute correctly.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Algebraically demonstrate that the parallelogram's sides are all equal by using the tangent segment equalities and the property of opposite sides being equal.
  - Pass if: Correctly manipulates the equations derived from parallelogram properties (e.g., AP + PB = CR + DR and BQ + QC = DS + SA) using the tangent segment equalities (e.g., AP = AS, BP = BQ, CQ = CR, DR = DS) to demonstrate that adjacent sides are equal (e.g., by showing AP = CR, or AB = BC).
  - Fail if: The algebraic manipulation is incorrect or does not lead to the equality of adjacent sides.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Conclude that since the parallelogram has all sides equal (as demonstrated in Step 4), it is a rhombus.
  - Pass if: Correctly concludes that the parallelogram is a rhombus based on the derived equality of all its sides.
  - Fail if: The conclusion is not drawn, or the conclusion is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A

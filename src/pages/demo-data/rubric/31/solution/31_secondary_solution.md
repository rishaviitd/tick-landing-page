**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 3 marks, requiring [3 to 6] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying. This question assesses the student's ability to apply geometric properties of circles and quadrilaterals to prove a specific theorem.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to draw a diagram, state the given properties of tangents and radii, consider the quadrilateral formed by the external point, points of contact, and the center, and use the angle sum property of quadrilaterals to derive the required proof.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Draws a correct geometrical diagram showing an external point P, a circle with center O, tangents PA and PB to the circle at points A and B respectively. Correctly labels all points and segments. States the given information (PA and PB are tangents from external point P to circle with center O at A and B) and the statement to be proved (∠APB + ∠AOB = 180°).
  - Pass if: Diagram is accurate, labeled correctly, and includes the statement to be proved.
  - Fail if: Diagram is inaccurate, missing labels, or the statement to be proved is not indicated.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: States the property that the radius drawn to the point of contact is perpendicular to the tangent. Applies this property to identify that OA ⊥ PA and OB ⊥ PB, thus ∠OAP = 90° and ∠OBP = 90°.
  - Pass if: Correctly states the property and correctly identifies both angles ∠OAP and ∠OBP as 90°.
  - Fail if: Fails to state the property or incorrectly identifies one or both angles.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the quadrilateral PAOB formed by the external point P, the points of contact A and B, and the center O. States the property that the sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360°.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies the quadrilateral PAOB and states the angle sum property for a quadrilateral.
  - Fail if: Fails to identify the quadrilateral or incorrectly states the angle sum property.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Writes the equation for the sum of angles in quadrilateral PAOB: ∠APB + ∠PBO + ∠BOA + ∠OAP = 360°. Substitutes the values of ∠OAP and ∠OBP (90° each) into the equation. Simplifies the equation to show that ∠APB + 90° + ∠BOA + 90° = 360°, which leads to ∠APB + ∠BOA = 180°.
  - Pass if: Correctly writes the angle sum equation for PAOB, substitutes the values of the right angles, and performs the algebraic simplification to reach the required conclusion.
  - Fail if: Makes an error in writing the equation, substitution, or simplification.
  - Mark Type: A

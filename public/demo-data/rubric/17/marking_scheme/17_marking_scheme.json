    "A square and a rhombus of the same area are always similar."
  ],
  "solution": "A square has all angles equal to 90 degrees. A rhombus that is not a square has angles that are not 90 degrees. For figures to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal. Therefore, a square and a non-square rhombus are not similar, regardless of their area."

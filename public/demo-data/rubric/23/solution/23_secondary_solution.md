**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to calculate the area of each of the three shaded sectors individually using the formula for the area of a sector and then sum these areas to find the total shaded area.
- Method 2: The plan is to first find the sum of the angles of the three shaded sectors and then calculate the total shaded area by applying the formula for the area of a sector using this combined angle.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: States the formula for the area of a sector and correctly identifies the given radius and the angles of the shaded sectors.
  - Pass if: The formula for the area of a sector ($\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$) is stated, and the radius ($r=5$ cm) and the angles ($35^\circ, 50^\circ, 95^\circ$) are correctly identified.
  - Fail if: The formula is incorrect or any of the parameters are misidentified.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the area of each of the three shaded sectors using the formula and the given values.
  - Pass if: The area of the sector with $35^\circ$, the sector with $50^\circ$, and the sector with $95^\circ$ are all calculated correctly using $\pi = 22/7$ and $r=5$ cm.
  - Fail if: Any of the individual sector area calculations are incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Sums the calculated areas of the three sectors to find the total shaded area.
  - Pass if: The areas calculated in Step 2 are added correctly to obtain the final total shaded area.
  - Fail if: The summation is incorrect or the final answer is wrong.
  - Mark Type: A

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: States the formula for the area of a sector and correctly identifies the given radius.
  - Pass if: The formula for the area of a sector ($\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$) is stated, and the radius ($r=5$ cm) is correctly identified.
  - Fail if: The formula is incorrect or the radius is misidentified.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the sum of the angles of the shaded sectors.
  - Pass if: The sum of the angles $35^\circ + 50^\circ + 95^\circ$ is correctly calculated as $180^\circ$.
  - Fail if: The sum of the angles is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the total shaded area by substituting the combined angle and radius into the area of a sector formula.
  - Pass if: The total shaded area is calculated correctly by using the combined angle ($180^\circ$) and radius ($5$ cm) in the formula, with $\pi = 22/7$.
  - Fail if: The calculation is incorrect.

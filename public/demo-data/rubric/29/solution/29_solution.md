**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 3 marks, requiring [3 to 6] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The student must assume $\sqrt{3}$ is rational, express it as a fraction in its simplest form, manipulate the equation algebraically to show that both the numerator and denominator must be divisible by 3, leading to a contradiction, and thus conclude that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: States the assumption that $\sqrt{3}$ is rational and represents it in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers, $q \neq 0$, and $p$ and $q$ are coprime (i.e., $\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$).
  - Pass if: The assumption of rationality and the fractional representation with the coprime condition are correctly stated.
  - Fail if: The assumption is incorrect, the representation is wrong, or the coprime condition is omitted.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Squares both sides of the equation $\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ to get $3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$ and correctly rearranges it to $3q^2 = p^2$.
  - Pass if: The squaring and algebraic rearrangement are performed accurately.
  - Fail if: Errors are made in squaring or rearranging the equation.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Infers from $3q^2 = p^2$ that $p^2$ is divisible by 3, and consequently, $p$ must also be divisible by 3.
  - Pass if: The logical deduction that $p$ is divisible by 3 is correctly made.
  - Fail if: The inference about divisibility is incorrect or omitted.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Expresses $p$ as $3k$ (where $k$ is an integer) and substitutes this into the equation $3q^2 = p^2$, leading to $3q^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2$, and simplifies it to $q^2 = 3k^2$.
  - Pass if: The substitution $p=3k$ is correct and the subsequent simplification to $q^2 = 3k^2$ is accurate.
  - Fail if: Errors occur in the substitution or simplification process.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Infers from $q^2 = 3k^2$ that $q^2$ is divisible by 3, and consequently, $q$ must also be divisible by 3.
  - Pass if: The logical deduction that $q$ is divisible by 3 is correctly made.
  - Fail if: The inference about divisibility is incorrect or omitted.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: States that $p$ and $q$ being divisible by 3 contradicts the initial assumption that they are coprime, and concludes that $\sqrt{3}$ must be irrational.
  - Pass if: The contradiction is clearly identified, and the final conclusion that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational is stated.
  - Fail if: The contradiction is not explained, or the final conclusion is missing or incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A

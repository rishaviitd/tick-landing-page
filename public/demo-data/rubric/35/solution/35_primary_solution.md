# Solution for 35_primary

**Question:** 35. (a) The angle of elevation of an airborne helicopter from a point A on the ground is 45°. After a flight of 15 seconds, the angle of elevation of the helicopter changes to 30°. If the helicopter is flying at a constant height of 2000 m, find the speed of the helicopter. (Take $\sqrt{3} = 1.732$)

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 5 marks, requiring [5 to 10] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to draw a diagram representing the scenario, use trigonometric ratios (tangent) in two right-angled triangles to calculate the horizontal distances from the observation point to the helicopter's initial and final positions, determine the distance the helicopter traveled horizontally, and finally calculate its speed using the given time.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Draws an accurate diagram representing the problem. This should include the observation point (A), the helicopter at its initial and final positions, the constant vertical height, and the two angles of elevation (45° and 30°).
  - Pass if: A clear, labeled diagram showing two right-angled triangles, the height, and the correct angles of elevation is drawn.
  - Fail if: The diagram is inaccurate, incomplete, or missing key labels.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the first right-angled triangle formed by the observation point (A), the initial position of the helicopter, and the point directly below it on the ground. The angle of elevation is 45°.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies the relevant triangle and its components (height, adjacent side, angle).
  - Fail if: Incorrect triangle or components are identified.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the tangent trigonometric ratio (tan 45°) to calculate the horizontal distance from point A to the initial position of the helicopter.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates the initial horizontal distance as 2000 m (since tan 45° = 1, and 1 = 2000 / distance).
  - Fail if: Calculation error or incorrect use of tan 45°.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the second right-angled triangle formed by the observation point (A), the final position of the helicopter, and the point directly below it on the ground. The angle of elevation is 30°.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies the second relevant triangle and its components.
  - Fail if: Incorrect triangle or components are identified.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the tangent trigonometric ratio (tan 30°) to calculate the total horizontal distance from point A to the final position of the helicopter.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates the final horizontal distance as 2000√3 m (or 2000 / (1/√3)).
  - Fail if: Calculation error or incorrect use of tan 30°.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the actual horizontal distance traveled by the helicopter by finding the difference between the final and initial horizontal distances.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates the distance traveled as 2000√3 - 2000 m, or 2000(√3 - 1) m.
  - Fail if: Calculation error in subtraction.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 7:
  - Step ID: 7
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the speed of the helicopter using the formula Speed = Distance / Time, substituting the calculated distance and the given time (15 seconds), and using $\sqrt{3} = 1.732$.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates the speed as 97.6 m/s.
  - Fail if: Calculation error or incorrect substitution of $\sqrt{3}$.
  - Mark Type: A

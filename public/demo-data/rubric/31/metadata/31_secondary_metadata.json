  "assessment_intent": "This question assesses the student's ability to prove a geometric theorem related to tangents drawn from an external point to a circle. It requires applying properties of tangents, such as perpendicularity to the radius and equal lengths from an external point, along with triangle congruence, to demonstrate that the angle between the tangents is supplementary to the angle subtended by the chord of contact at the center.",

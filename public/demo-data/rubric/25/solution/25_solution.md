**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 2 marks, requiring [2 to 4] steps for the entire solution. **I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.**
- Bloom's Level: Applying.
- Assessment Intent: To check the student's ability to find trigonometric ratios from a given ratio and evaluate a trigonometric expression.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first identify the specific angle A from the given tangent value, state the corresponding sine and cosine values, substitute them into the expression, and then simplify to find the final answer.
- Method 2: The plan is to derive the sine and cosine values from the given tangent value using either a right-angled triangle or trigonometric identities, substitute these derived values into the expression, and then simplify to find the final answer.

**Method 1: Using Standard Angle Values**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Recognizes that for an acute angle A, $tan A = \sqrt{3}$ implies $A = 60^\circ$.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies the angle A as $60^\circ$.
  - Fail if: Fails to identify the correct angle or makes an error in recognition.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: States the correct values for $sin 60^\circ$ and $cos 60^\circ$.
  - Pass if: Correctly states $sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$.
  - Fail if: States incorrect values for $sin 60^\circ$ or $cos 60^\circ$.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Substitutes the values of $sin A$ and $cos A$ into the expression $\frac{sin^2 A}{1 + cos^2 A}$.
  - Pass if: Correctly substitutes $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2$ for $sin^2 A$ and $(\frac{1}{2})^2$ for $cos^2 A$.
  - Fail if: Makes an error in substitution.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Evaluates the expression to find the final answer.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates $\frac{(\sqrt{3}/2)^2}{1 + (1/2)^2} = \frac{3/4}{1 + 1/4} = \frac{3/4}{5/4} = \frac{3}{5}$.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic error in evaluation.
  - Mark Type: A

**Method 2: Deriving Ratios using Triangle/Identities**
---
- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Determines the values of $sin A$ and $cos A$ from $tan A = \sqrt{3}$. This can be done by constructing a right-angled triangle (e.g., opposite=$\sqrt{3}$, adjacent=1, hypotenuse=2) or using identities ($sec^2 A = 1+tan^2 A$).
  - Pass if: Correctly derives $sin A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $cos A = \frac{1}{2}$.
  - Fail if: Makes an error in deriving either $sin A$ or $cos A$.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: States the determined values of $sin A$ and $cos A$.
  - Pass if: Correctly states $sin A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $cos A = \frac{1}{2}$.
  - Fail if: States incorrect values.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Substitutes the values of $sin A$ and $cos A$ into the expression $\frac{sin^2 A}{1 + cos^2 A}$.
  - Pass if: Correctly substitutes $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2$ for $sin^2 A$ and $(\frac{1}{2})^2$ for $cos^2 A$.
  - Fail if: Makes an error in substitution.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Evaluates the expression to find the final answer.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates $\frac{(\sqrt{3}/2)^2}{1 + (1/2)^2} = \frac{3/4}{1 + 1/4} = \frac{3/4}{5/4} = \frac{3}{5}$.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic error in evaluation.

  "solution": "The arithmetic progression has a common difference of 4. The last term is 147. To find the 9th term from the end, we first determine the total number of terms (n=36). The 9th term from the end is equivalent to the (36 - 9 + 1) = 28th term from the beginning, which calculates to 115."

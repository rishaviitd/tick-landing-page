  "solution": "The lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by vertices (0,0), (2,0), and (0,2) are calculated using the distance formula. The sides are 2 units, 2 units, and $2\\[0.5ex\\]sqrt{2}$ units. The perimeter is the sum of these lengths: $2 + 2 + 2\\[0.5ex\\]sqrt{2} = (4+2\\[0.5ex\\]sqrt{2})$ units."

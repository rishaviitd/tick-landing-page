  "Question_specific_notes": "Students should be carefully guided to identify the correct corresponding sides when stating the proportionality after establishing similarity. Common errors include incorrect ratio setup or misidentification of corresponding vertices. Ensure 'Error Carried Forward' (ecf) is applied if students make an error in similarity statement but correctly use it for ratios."

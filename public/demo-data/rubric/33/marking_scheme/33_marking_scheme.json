  "Question_specific_notes": "This question requires students to first prove the Basic Proportionality Theorem (BPT) and then apply it to a given figure. Ensure that students correctly state the theorem, perform accurate geometric constructions, and use area ratios appropriately for the proof. For the application part, students must correctly identify the relevant triangles and parallel lines and apply the BPT. Common errors may include incorrect construction, flawed area calculations, or misapplication of the theorem in the second part. Award follow-through (ft) marks where applicable for errors carried forward."

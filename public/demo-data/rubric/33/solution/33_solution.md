- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: States the Basic Proportionality Theorem (BPT) to be proved: "If a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides in distinct points, then it divides the other two sides in the same ratio."
  - Pass if: The statement of the BPT is correctly written.
  - Fail if: The statement of the BPT is incorrect or incomplete.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Draws a general triangle ABC and a line segment DE parallel to BC, where D is on AB and E is on AC.
  - Pass if: A clear diagram of $\triangle ABC$ with DE || BC is drawn, with points D on AB and E on AC.
  - Fail if: The diagram is missing, incorrect, or labels are missing/incorrect.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Performs the necessary construction: Draws $DM \perp AB$ and $EN \perp AC$. Joins BE and CD. (Note: Standard proof often uses $DM \perp AC$ and $EN \perp AB$. Let's use $DM \perp AB$ and $EN \perp AC$ for this step, ensuring consistency with area calculations).
  - Pass if: The required perpendiculars (DM and EN) and line segments (BE, CD) are correctly drawn and indicated in the diagram.
  - Fail if: Construction is incorrect or missing.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the area of $\triangle ADE$ and $\triangle BDE$ using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$, expressing the ratio $Area(\triangle ADE) / Area(\triangle BDE)$ in terms of AD/DB.
  - Pass if: Correctly expresses $Area(\triangle ADE) = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times EN$ and $Area(\triangle BDE) = \frac{1}{2} \times DB \times EN$, leading to $Area(\triangle ADE) / Area(\triangle BDE) = AD/DB$.
  - Fail if: Area calculations or ratio expression is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the area of $\triangle ADE$ and $\triangle CDE$ using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$, expressing the ratio $Area(\triangle ADE) / Area(\triangle CDE)$ in terms of AE/EC.
  - Pass if: Correctly expresses $Area(\triangle ADE) = \frac{1}{2} \times AE \times DM$ and $Area(\triangle CDE) = \frac{1}{2} \times EC \times DM$, leading to $Area(\triangle ADE) / Area(\triangle CDE) = AE/EC$.
  - Fail if: Area calculations or ratio expression is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: States that $\triangle BDE$ and $\triangle CDE$ have equal areas because they share the same base DE and lie between the same parallel lines DE and BC.
  - Pass if: Correctly states that $Area(\triangle BDE) = Area(\triangle CDE)$ and provides the reason (same base, same parallels).
  - Fail if: The equality of areas is not stated or the reason is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 7:
  - Step ID: 7
  - Teacher Expectation: Equates the ratios obtained in Step 4 and Step 5 using the equality from Step 6 to conclude the proof of BPT: $AD/DB = AE/EC$.
  - Pass if: Correctly equates the ratios to arrive at $AD/DB = AE/EC$.
  - Fail if: The conclusion of BPT is not derived correctly.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step 8:
  - Step ID: 8
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies $\triangle ABC$ and the line segment LM parallel to CB, with L on AC and M on AB, as given in the problem figure.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies $\triangle ABC$ and the parallel condition LM || CB.
  - Fail if: Incorrect triangle or parallel condition is identified.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 9:
  - Step ID: 9
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the proved BPT to $\triangle ABC$ with LM || CB to establish the ratio $AM/MB = AL/LC$.
  - Pass if: Correctly applies BPT to $\triangle ABC$ to get $AM/MB = AL/LC$.
  - Fail if: BPT is misapplied or the ratio is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 10:
  - Step ID: 10
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies $\triangle ADC$ and the line segment LN parallel to CD, with L on AC and N on AD, as given in the problem figure. Then, applies the proved BPT to $\triangle ADC$ with LN || CD to establish the ratio $AN/ND = AL/LC$. Finally, equates the ratios from Step 9 and Step 10 to prove $AM/MB = AN/ND$.
  - Pass if: Correctly identifies $\triangle ADC$, applies BPT to get $AN/ND = AL/LC$, and then equates the ratios from Step 9 and this step to conclude $AM/MB = AN/ND$.
  - Fail if: Any part of the application or conclusion is incorrect.

- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to first establish that the chord CD is perpendicular to the diameter AB and determine its distance from the center O. Then, use the Pythagorean theorem in the right-angled triangle formed by the center, the chord's midpoint, and one endpoint of the chord to find half the chord length, and finally double it to get the total length.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies that the chord CD is perpendicular to the diameter AB because it is parallel to the tangent XAY at A, which is perpendicular to the radius OA. Calculates the distance of chord CD from the center O as the absolute difference between the radius OA and the given distance from A along the diameter: |10 cm - 16 cm| = 6 cm.
  - Pass if: Correctly states CD ⊥ AB and correctly calculates the distance of CD from O as 6 cm.
  - Fail if: Fails to establish CD ⊥ AB or incorrectly calculates the distance from O.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the Pythagorean theorem to the right-angled triangle formed by the center O, the midpoint P of chord CD, and an endpoint C of the chord (triangle OPC). States the relationship OC² = OP² + PC², where OC is the radius (10 cm) and OP is the distance from the center (6 cm).
  - Pass if: Correctly states the Pythagorean theorem applied to triangle OPC with correct substitution of OC and OP values.
  - Fail if: Incorrectly states the theorem or substitutes incorrect values.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Solves the Pythagorean equation to find the length of PC, which is half the chord length: PC = √(OC² - OP²) = √(10² - 6²) = √64 = 8 cm.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates PC = 8 cm.
  - Fail if: Calculation error in finding PC.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the full length of chord CD by doubling the length of PC: CD = 2 * PC = 2 * 8 cm = 16 cm.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates the final length of CD as 16 cm.
  - Fail if: Calculation error in doubling PC or final answer is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A

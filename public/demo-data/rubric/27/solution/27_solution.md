- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies the coordinates of the given points A(10, – 6) and B(k, 4).
  - Pass if: Correctly lists the coordinates of point A as (10, -6) and point B as (k, 4).
  - Fail if: Lists incorrect coordinates for either point or omits one.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: States the midpoint formula for a line segment joining $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.
  - Pass if: Correctly states the midpoint formula as $M(x, y) = (\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$.
  - Fail if: States an incorrect formula or omits parts of the formula.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Applies the midpoint formula to express the coordinates of the midpoint (a, b) in terms of k.
  - Pass if: Correctly sets up the expressions for 'a' as $\frac{10+k}{2}$ and 'b' as $\frac{-6+4}{2}$.
  - Fail if: Makes an error in applying the midpoint formula (e.g., incorrect pairing of coordinates, sign errors).
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the numerical value of the y-coordinate of the midpoint, b.
  - Pass if: Correctly calculates $b = \frac{-2}{2} = -1$.
  - Fail if: Makes an arithmetic error in simplifying the expression for 'b'.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Substitutes the expression for 'a' and the calculated value of 'b' into the given linear equation $a - 2b = 18$.
  - Pass if: Correctly substitutes $\frac{10+k}{2}$ for 'a' and -1 for 'b' into the equation, resulting in $\frac{10+k}{2} - 2(-1) = 18$.
  - Fail if: Makes an incorrect substitution of values or expressions into the equation.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: Solves the resulting linear equation to find the value of k.
  - Pass if: Correctly solves the equation $\frac{10+k}{2} + 2 = 18$ to arrive at $k = 22$.
  - Fail if: Makes errors in algebraic manipulation or calculation, leading to an incorrect value for k.
  - Mark Type: A

  "Question_specific_notes": "Students must correctly define variables for speeds, set up the time equations, form a quadratic equation, solve it, and interpret the roots to find the speeds in both directions. Pay close attention to the correct formulation of the time difference equation and the subsequent algebraic manipulation. Ensure that 'Error Carried Forward' (ecf) is applied appropriately for calculation errors in subsequent steps."

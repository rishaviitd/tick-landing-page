# Solution for 32_secondary

**Question:** (b) The time taken by a person to travel an upward distance of 150 km was $2 \frac{1}{2}$ hours more than the time taken in the downward return journey. If he returned at a speed of 10 km/h more than the speed while going up, find the speeds in each direction.

**Question Type:** Subjective

**Reasoning:**
- This question has no sub-parts. It is worth 5 marks, requiring [5 to 10] steps for the entire solution.
- I will strictly adhere to this step count for each method.
- Bloom's Level: Applying.

**Method solution:**
- Method 1: The plan is to define variables for the unknown speeds, express the time taken for each journey using the distance and speeds, form an equation based on the given time difference, convert this into a standard quadratic equation, solve the quadratic equation, and finally interpret the roots to find the speeds in each direction.

- Step 1:
  - Step ID: 1
  - Teacher Expectation: Identifies and defines the speed for the upward journey using a variable (e.g., $x$ km/h).
  - Pass if: A variable is correctly assigned to the upward speed.
  - Fail if: Fails to define a variable for the upward speed or assigns it incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 2:
  - Step ID: 2
  - Teacher Expectation: Defines the speed for the downward return journey in terms of the upward speed (e.g., $x+10$ km/h).
  - Pass if: The return speed is correctly expressed as $x+10$ km/h.
  - Fail if: The return speed is incorrectly expressed or not defined.
  - Mark Type: B
- Step 3:
  - Step ID: 3
  - Teacher Expectation: Expresses the time taken for the upward journey using the distance (150 km) and the defined upward speed.
  - Pass if: Time up is correctly stated as $\frac{150}{x}$ hours.
  - Fail if: The expression for time up is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 4:
  - Step ID: 4
  - Teacher Expectation: Expresses the time taken for the downward return journey using the distance (150 km) and the defined return speed.
  - Pass if: Time down is correctly stated as $\frac{150}{x+10}$ hours.
  - Fail if: The expression for time down is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 5:
  - Step ID: 5
  - Teacher Expectation: Formulates the equation relating the times based on the given time difference ($2 \frac{1}{2}$ hours or $\frac{5}{2}$ hours).
  - Pass if: The equation $\frac{150}{x} = \frac{150}{x+10} + \frac{5}{2}$ is correctly set up.
  - Fail if: The equation is incorrectly formulated.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 6:
  - Step ID: 6
  - Teacher Expectation: Simplifies the formulated equation and rearranges it into the standard quadratic form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
  - Pass if: The equation is correctly simplified to a standard quadratic form (e.g., $x^2 + 10x - 600 = 0$).
  - Fail if: Errors occur during simplification or rearrangement.
  - Mark Type: M
- Step 7:
  - Step ID: 7
  - Teacher Expectation: Solves the quadratic equation using an appropriate method (e.g., factorization, quadratic formula).
  - Pass if: The roots of the quadratic equation are correctly found (e.g., $x = 20$ and $x = -30$).
  - Fail if: Errors are made in solving the quadratic equation.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step 8:
  - Step ID: 8
  - Teacher Expectation: Selects the physically valid speed for the upward journey from the obtained roots.
  - Pass if: The positive root (e.g., $x=20$ km/h) is correctly identified as the upward speed.
  - Fail if: The negative root is chosen or no valid speed is selected.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step 9:
  - Step ID: 9
  - Teacher Expectation: Calculates the speed for the downward return journey using the valid upward speed.
  - Pass if: The return speed is correctly calculated as $20 + 10 = 30$ km/h.
  - Fail if: The return speed calculation is incorrect.
  - Mark Type: A
- Step 10:
  - Step ID: 10
  - Teacher Expectation: States the speeds for both the upward and downward journeys clearly.
  - Pass if: Both speeds (upward and downward) are correctly stated in the final answer.
  - Fail if: Either speed is missing or stated incorrectly.
  - Mark Type: A
